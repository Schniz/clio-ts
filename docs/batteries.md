# Battery Packs

Batteries, from the term "batteries included", are optional imports you can use in your application but aren't needed in every application. They might have dependencies of their own peer dependencies or run only in a specific runtime (browser, Node.js).

Here are some battery packs:

- [File System](./batteries_file_system.md)
- [URL](./batteries_url.md)
